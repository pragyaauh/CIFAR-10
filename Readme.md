# CIFAR-10 
The project is about training and testing CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch.

##About CIFAR data set
CIFAR-10H is a new dataset of soft labels reflecting human perceptual uncertainty for the 10,000-image CIFAR-10 test set, first appearing in the paper:

Joshua C. Peterson*, Ruairidh M. Battleday*, Thomas L. Griffiths, & Olga Russakovsky (2019). Human uncertainty makes classification more robust. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision. (preprint)

And more recently in:

Ruairidh M. Battleday*, Joshua C. Peterson*, & Thomas L. Griffiths (2020). Capturing human categorization of natural images by combining deep networks and cognitive models. (preprint)

##Data
The notebook is run on **pytorch**.The data is available in the datasets provided by pytorch.

##KeySteps
CNN model creation
PyTorch loading &running the model
Gradient optimization
Confusion Matrix
